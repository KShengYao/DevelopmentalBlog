# Week1
So week1 lesson we learn about all the different type of Description and
how does an element look like so this are a few examples:

<ul>
  <li>Action starts when theres a <> and the ending will have a slash at the back </></li>
  <li>Child parent Relationship and Nested relationship work when a parents relation like <(p)> and the child element would be the things u wan it to appear in ur website like <(em)> </li>
</ul>  
Other key elements would be like html,body and head
And some elements that we would use when doing the html would be like paragraph, header, image, lists.

# Week2
So week 2 lesson we learn about semantic web and some Semantics relates to syntaxSemantics is the meaning behind words, phrases. In our case it is the HTML:

Examples would be:
<ul>
  <li>The div element itself has no inherent meaning. It is simply container, and there's often a more specific semantic choice.</li>

  <li> <(p)> tag tells us that the content is a paragraph </li>

  <li> Not to be confused with <(head)> and <(header)> because is usually used for navigation or introductory content and commonly use d for news content blog posts or independent content piece.</li>

  <li> Usually for location of the menu links This is for key navigation elements in the site and NOT for every link in a site..</li>
</ul>  

Common Elements would be:
<ul>
  <li>header</li>
  <li>nav</li>
  <li>article</li>
  <li>section</li>
  <li>table</li>
  <li>details</li>
  <li>figures</li>
</ul>  

We also learn Cascading style sheets(CSS) and it helps defines the style of the HTML like making texts green and its the "adjectives" of a webpage
